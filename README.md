# elastic-catenary
simulate elastic catenary with html5 canvas and javascript

* * *

### distance between two points when no force is applied

Distance when the spring is not deformed



### toggleStretchOnly

Turn on to apply elastic force only when the distance between two points is greater then the "distance between two points when no force is applied"



### toggleMovement

Turn on to calculate the sum of velocities and the average velocity



### export coordinates to json 

gives you a 2d array

[[x0, y0],[x1, y1],[x2, y2]...]

## physical description

Hooke's law applies when calculating the elastic force
